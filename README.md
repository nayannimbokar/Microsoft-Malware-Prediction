# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction

## Abstract
The internet has been widely used in this new
technical era. As a result, the risk of cybercriminals launching
malware attacks has risen. The number of malware samples
captured and analyzed by antivirus firms has increased
exponentially in recent years. Malware is used in these attacks,
which have caused billions of dollars in financial harm. As a
result, malware intrusion detection has become a critical
component of the fight against cybercrime. Machine Learning
has grown its importance in the area of malware prediction in
recent years. So, we have used machine learning algorithms in
this study to forecast the malware prediction in computers
based on their characteristics. We used different machine
learning algorithms like Gradient boosting, ADA boost, Neural
Network, Light GBM, Decision tree and many more. We have
collected the dataset which is available over the internet
provided by Microsoft on Kaggle which has nearly 16M
machines for training and testing. We have preprocessed the
dataset and applied feature engineering techniques and trained
it on different algorithms. After analyzing the results, we came
to a conclusion that, LightGBM is discovered to be the best
model with great memory efficiency and low runtime among 11
different algorithms. So, LightGBM is the best gradient
boosting algorithm in predicting the malware detection
problem.

## Conclusion
In our project, we have compared the eleven different
machine learning algorithms including, Light GBM,
Gradient Boosting, Xgboost, Decision Tree, AdaBoost
Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
MLPClassifier- Neural Network, KNeighborsClassifier,
SVM and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Various cross
validation techniques were used to analyze the performance
of these algorithms. Before that, the dataset provided by
Microsoft is studied and various data optimisation techniques
along with feature engineering are used to reduce and clean
the dataset. The data is optimized, which helps us in reducing
the memory usage and also saving the runtime. After training
the dataset on above mentioned algorithms, various
parameters are studied and analyzed. Then from that based
on AUC score we choose the Light GBM model to process it
with better hyperparameter tuning. So Light GBM provides
the better results along with great efficiency and low
runtime. This shows that Light GBM is the best gradient
boosting algorithm in predicting the malware detection
problem. So, the Light GBM model has a great potential in
predicting the malware hits and improving the cyber security
for the future which will eventually lead in saving billions of
dollars.
