# Microsoft-Malware-Prediction
# Abstract
The internet has been widely used in this new
technical era. As a result, the risk of cybercriminals launching
malware attacks has risen. The number of malware samples
captured and analyzed by antivirus firms has increased
exponentially in recent years. Malware is used in these attacks,
which have caused billions of dollars in financial harm. As a
result, malware intrusion detection has become a critical
component of the fight against cybercrime. Machine Learning
has grown its importance in the area of malware prediction in
recent years. So, we have used machine learning algorithms in
this study to forecast the malware prediction in computers
based on their characteristics. We used different machine
learning algorithms like Gradient boosting, ADA boost, Neural
Network, Light GBM, Decision tree and many more. We have
collected the dataset which is available over the internet
provided by Microsoft on Kaggle which has nearly 16M
machines for training and testing. We have preprocessed the
dataset and applied feature engineering techniques and trained
it on different algorithms. After analyzing the results, we came
to a conclusion that, LightGBM is discovered to be the best
model with great memory efficiency and low runtime among 11
different algorithms. So, LightGBM is the best gradient
boosting algorithm in predicting the malware detection
problem.
